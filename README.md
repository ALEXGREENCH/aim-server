# AOL Instant Messenger Server

This is a (very wip) server-side implementation of the [Oscar Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSCAR_protocol), used by [AOL Instant Messenger](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIM_(software)>) and later versions of [ICQ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICQ).

## Working

-   Login currently works up to the point of the auth client/server auth challenge
